# Physical-Assistant-App-Gesture-Recognition-
The key aim of the hand motion gesture application is to develop a system that can recognize particular hand gestures made by people and utilize them to communicate information or carry out commands and controls. As a result, it involves both tracking human hand movement and interpreting that movement as an important command. The method is based on computer vision for bare hands.
